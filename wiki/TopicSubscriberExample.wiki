== Your Delegate Method ==
Your method should be thread safe. With multiple sources, the method will be called from multiple threads. Also, do not retain a reference the parser object since it is reused between objects. 

= Topic Queue Subscriber =
Currently, only available in [http://emcaster.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Emcaster/Topics/TopicQueueSubscriber.cs SVN]. 

A Topic Queue Subscription enqueues messages in a single capped queue. This makes it easy to process messages in batch. The Dequeue method is thread safe, so with a multi-core machine, multiple threads can be used to process cpu intensive messages. 

{{{
TopicSubscriber topic= ... create a subscriber
topic.Start();
int maxQueueSize = 100000;
TopicQueueSubscriber queue = new TopicQueueSubscriber(topic, maxQueueSize);
while(true)
{
   int maxTimeToWaitForMessage = 1000;
   List<IMessageParser> msgBatch = queue.Dequeue(maxTimeToWaitForMessage);
   ... do something with messages
}

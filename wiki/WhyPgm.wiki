Emcaster is a _reliable_ messaging framework. It provides at most once delivery to your application. If you need guaranteed delivery, take a look at MSMQ or ActiveMQ. 

PGM provides an ideal transport for reliable messaging.

  * In Order Delivery - The protocol will order messages if the messages arrive out of order
  * NAK based messaging - If a message is missed, the source will request a repair packet.
  * Multicast - Supports multiple consumers

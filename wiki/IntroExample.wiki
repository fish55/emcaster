== Message Format ==

Emcaster works with any message format. Messages are published as simple byte arrays which could represent an XML document or a raw struct. The core Emcaster library can handle several hundred thousand messages per second at the raw transport layer. The marshaling overhead of the messages can often be the limiting factor for throughput, so choose the appropriate marshaling strategy for the expected volume. 

If publishing messages across languages or platforms, XML is usually a safe choice. A common approach is to define an explicit message contract with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xsd XSD].
